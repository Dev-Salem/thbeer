I contributed to Qoranthon, a hackathon focusing on leveraging modern technology for the Quran.

## Overview
Thbeer is a groundbreaking proof of concept employing AI to assist users in reading the Quran with accurate tones and emotions (قراءة تفسيرية). It annotates each verse with the appropriate tone, provides users with feedback on their reading, and pinpoints the exact location of any mistakes made during the recitation.
